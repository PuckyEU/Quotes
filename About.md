Hi, I'm an Indie developer, and I'm trying to make the best apps I possibly can.

This is an open source app, so you can find the apps code on my [Github Page](https://github.com/lukassobotik/Quotes).

The quotes that are provided by @myQuotes are fetched from [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes), 
so if you like any of them, you should definitely check them out.
