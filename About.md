Hi, [I'm](https://github.com/lukassobotik) an Indie developer, and I'm trying to make the best apps I possibly can.

This is an open-source app, so the code can be found on its [Github Page](https://github.com/lukassobotik/Quotes).

The quotes that are provided by **`@myQuotes`** are fetched from [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes), 
so if you like any of them, you should check them out.
